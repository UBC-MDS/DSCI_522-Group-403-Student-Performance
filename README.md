Investigating student performance in Portugal.

## Milestone 1 Proposal

### Section 1: Selected Data Set

Our selected data set summarizes student's achievements in secondary education for two Portuguese schools. The data was compiled from official school reports as well as questionaires provided to students. Attributes include the student grades, demographic, social and other school related features. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). 

For additional information, refer to the following:

### Section 2: Research Question

- Identify one main predictive or inferential research question that you will attempt to answer with analyses and visualizations (more on this below). 
- Clearly state the research question and any natural sub-questions you need to address, and their type.


### Section 3: Analysis Plan of Action

- Make a plan of how you will analyze the data (report an estimate and confidence intervals? hypothesis test? classification with a decision tree?). Choose something you already know how to do (report an estimate and confidence intervals, a two-group hypothesis, linear regression, classification with a decision tree, etc).
- Discuss at least one exploratory data analysis table and one exploratory data analysis figure you will create that makes sense for your research question, the data that you have, and the analysis you plan to do.
- Suggest how you would share the results of your analysis as one or more tables and/or figures.
- Note - Remember, if you have a predictive research question, it is essential that you separate your dataset before you do any analysis. To be clear, you should NOT do any analysis - including preliminary EDA - on your test data.
