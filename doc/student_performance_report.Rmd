# DSCI522 Group 403 - Student Performance Report

## Motivation & Data Set

Our selected data set summarizes Portuguese high school student's academic performance in both Math and Portuguese. For this project we are trying to answer the question: what are the top five features that most strongly predict high school student's performances in their Portuguese language course? In developing social intiatives to improve high school student performance, it could be immensely useful to understand what attributes play a strong role in predicting student performance. Without identifying these key factors, such intiatives would likely be less effective and would fail to provide a high return on the school board or government's investment.

The data set was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@CortezUCI] which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance), and the original research paper [@Cortezetal] can be found [here.](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf) The data was compiled from official school reports as well as questionaires provided to students. Attributes include the student grades, demographic, social and other school related features. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (`mat`) and Portuguese language (`por`). For the purpose of this analysis, we have decided to focus only on the Portuguese dataset to investigate which student attributes are the strongest predictors of performance in that subject.

Some key highlights regarding the data set's attributes:

- The feature of interest is `G3` which represents the final subject grade score at the end of the academic year. The score ranges from 0 to 20. 
- Multi-categorical attributes such as family size (`famsize`), parent's education (`Fedu`/`Medu`) or weekly study time (`studytime`)
- Binary attributes such as home internet access (`internet`) or family educational support (`famsup`)
- Count attributes such as number of days of absence (`absences`) or student's age (`age`)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before building our model, we partitioned the data into a training and test set (split 80%:20%) and performed exploratory data analysis to investigate the distribution of our predictive features and explore whether there are any highly correlated features we might want to ommit from our analysis.

Figure 1 - Feature Correlations

As we can see from the correlation matrix, our target attribute `G3` has a strong correlation with attributes `G2` and `G1`. This occurs because `G3` is the grade issued at the end of the year, while `G1` and `G2` correspond to the grades for the 1st and 2nd school terms of that year. Though it will be more difficult to get accurate predictions without these features, it makes sense to drop them in light of our research question and motivations outlined above. We're more interested in which attributes, other than recent acadmemic performance, will be most predictive of future academic performance.

Figure 3 - Feature Scatterplot for Absences

Looking at the feature distributions, we can see that some of the most noteworthy features include student's past number of course failures (`failures`), parental education levels (`Medu`, `Fedu`), alcohol consumption on weekdays and the weekeend (`Dalc`, `Walc`), and the school they attended (`school`). Each of these appears to show a clear trend with respect to G3, so we would expect to see some of these features having strong predictive power in the machine learning models we develop. 

The student's number of absences (`absences`) does not appear to show a strong correlation with our target variable.

Figure 3 - Distribution of Response Variable, G3

Our response variable shows an approximately normal distribution, with a mean/median of abc out of 20. There are outliers at the low end which end up dragging down the mean value.

## Predictive Modelling

To answer the predictive question posed above, we built and compared several predictive regression models. We constructed the following models, optimizing each according to the specified hyperparameters. Model performance was evaluated using RMSE.

We found that the RandomForest model performed best with a RMSE of xyz (figure/table?). 

#### TODO: Do we need to justify model choices more? simplified version of what tiffanys done below?
    Given that all measurements are continuous in nature, and the outcome we are trying to predict is one of two classes, one suitable and simple approach that we plan to first explore is using a k-nearest neighbours classification algorithm. 
    
    - With this algorithm, we will have to choose K, the number of nearest neighbours to use for prediction. 
    - We will choose K via cross-validation using ~ 30 folds because this Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set is not very large, having only 569 observations. We will use overall accuracy to choose K. 
    - A line plot of overall accuracy versus $K$ will be included as part of the final report for this project.

## Ranked Features & Conclusions

The top five ranked features from our Random Forest regression model were as follows:

For the most part, the results are inline with our expectations following EDA. One noteworthy observation is the importance of `absences`. Although it was not evident from our EDA scattlerplot, absences turned out to be a strong predictor.  
#### TODO: Update based on brayden's new plot. 

Given we have identified attributes that predict academic performance, this information could be very useful when developing social programs or intitatives intending to improve student's academic performance. Targetting these attributes should improve the effectiveness of the programs and thereby provide better return on investment for those initiatives. 

## Reflections & Next Steps

#### TODO: Not using the right regression approach? Brayden notes

We dropped features `G1` and `G2` after our EDA with the intent of removing features based on recent academic performance. `Failures`, which ended up being our top predictor, is highly correlated with `G1` and `G2` and could perhaps be removed in subsequent analysis attempting to focus on non-academic predictive attributes.

For this analysis, we focused on only one of two available student performance data sets. We looked at student performance in Portuguese, rather than Math. In the future it would be interesting to explore whether the same model features are strong predictors across both subjects, or whether different subjects are predicted better by different features. We would be curious to see if performance in Math is strongly predicted by the 'going out with friends' attribute, for example.
